# CSCI235
These are my projects that I have done for my CSCI235 class

Project 1:
Implementation of a simple framework for a “Little Farm” RTS game.
The tractor class stores the location, size, and activity of the tractor, the game class stores the map size, a list of all tractors, and a list of currently selected tractors.

Project 2:
Implementation of a back-tracking algorithm for a length-based attack.

Project 3:
An emulation of the map class that already exists in C++.
